## Problem Specifications

Participants need to develop a health app, which calculates and saves various health-related information of the user. This app will measure how much distance s/he has walked and how many leaps s/he has completed. The app will also be able to determine a userâ€™s heart rate. Low power consumption and low bandwidth usage are preferred. If internet connection is not available, the app will continue to collect data and save it locally and whenever it is connected back to the internet, it will synchronize data with the server. The server will analyze data and show various statistics to the user. A secured connection must be set up between the server and app. 

Key Features:

- Authentication
- Measure travelled distance 
- Measure leap count
- Collect data in a way that will require less sensor access and consume less power.
- Store data when offline, then sync with the server
- A secure connection between the app and the rest API server.
- Calculate heart rate
- Add new health-related features of your own.
- Deploy the rest APIs on a public server so that app from anywhere can access it.
